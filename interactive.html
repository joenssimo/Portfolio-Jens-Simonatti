    <h2>Interactive Interface</h2>

    <p>The course interface and interaction was all about educating the visitor in an interactive way. Me and a
        classmate made an interface in Figma to educate people on a healthy diet and how much excersice you need to burn
        calories. The calories of the selected products will be counted up. After you can tap the spacebar to make the
        runner move. Then the calories will be burnt after each movement. We translated real excerice into a digital
        implementation. We were inspired by the aesthetics of the 2005 game SSX on tour.</p>
