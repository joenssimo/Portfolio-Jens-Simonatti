      <h2>Research on the Bronzo typeface</h2>

      <p>
        In a study project on typography, I explored the Bronzo typeface.I created a type specimen using HTML and CSS to
        showcase the unique characteristics and energy of Bronzo. Additionally, I designed a series of posters in Adobe
        Illustrator to further explore the expressive style of this typeface. This mix of digital and graphic design
        helped me gain a deeper understanding of Bronzo and present its potential effectively.

      <h2>Beatrepeat</h2>
      <p>In a school project called "Grid and Color," Its all about the needed skills for color use, grids, visual
        hierarchy, and flow in an interface design. I am also exploring color and composition to evoke the right mood
        and developing a personal design style, documented in my process report and visible in my prototype. </p>

      <h2>Visual language</h2>
      <p>In this course I made a parody on the legendary 1974, The Exorcist movie poster. I learned communication by
        exploring Semiotics. By Using Gestalt principles, I established visual hierarchy, balance, and flow, guiding the
        viewer’s eye. Finally, with Rhetoric, I persuaded through visuals, evoking emotion, building credibility, and
        communicating a clear message. By combining these elements, I created designs that are not only visually
        appealing but also impactful and memorable.</p>

    <h2>Animations</h2>
    <p>In this course I learned animation skills using Adobe after effects, Photoshop and AI. Inspired by street
      photography and electronic music I made a series of animations. My goal was to make ambient style videos which
      are in sync with the music. </p>

      <h2>interactive interface</h2>
      <p>The course interface and interaction was all about educating the visitor in an interactive way. Me and a
        classmate made an interface in Figma to educate people on a healthy diet and how much excersice you need to burn
        calories. The calories of the selected products will be counted up. After you can tap the spacebar to make the
        runner move. Then the calories will be burnt after each movement. We translated real excerice into a digital
        implementation.</p>

      <h2>interactive digital exposition</h2>
      <p>A digital exposition exploring the rise of house music in the Netherlands.
        In this project, I created an interactive interface that brings together multiple media elements, including
        music, fragments of a documentary, and animated typography.
        The viewer can explore and interact with these elements, resulting in a layered and immersive experience that
        captures the raw energy of the early club scene and the atmosphere of that era.</p>

      <h2>Illustrations</h2>
      <p>Creativity and especially drawing is one of the few places where I can enter a state of hyperfocus. It’s a
        calming and almost
        meditative experience, allowing me to shut out distractions and immerse myself completely in the moment. Art
        becomes not only a tool for self-expression but also a form of
        therapy.</p>
