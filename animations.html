        <h2>Animations</h2>
        <p>
            In this course I learned animation skills using Adobe after effects, Photoshop and AI. Inspired by street
            photography and electronic music I made a series of animations. My goal was to make ambient style videos
            which are in sync with the music.

            <h3>strange doorway</h3>
            <p>In this animation, I combined my own photographs with abstract shapes and AI-generated imagery. My goal
                was to create a visual journey that pulls the viewer into the image, where the scenes gradually become
                stranger and more abstract, blurring the boundary between reality and imagination.</p>

        <div class="video-text">
            <h3>Who's home?</h3>
            <p>In this animation, I started with a stock image and adjusted its colors to set the right mood. I then
                individually turned the windows purple in Photoshop and synced them so they are flickering to the music.
                As a
                result, the entire building seems to communicate with the rhythm of the sound.</p>

            <h3>peeking bricks</h3>
            <p>In this animation, I set out to create a skyline that continually expands and reshapes itself. By
                layering different images, I wanted to evoke the feeling that the skyline is watching you, rather than
                the other way around.</p>
