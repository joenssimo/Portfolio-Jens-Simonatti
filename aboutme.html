      <h2>Hi I am</h2>
      <h2>Jens Simonatti</h2>
      <p>A Bachelor’s degree student in Communication and Multimedia Design based in Amsterdam. My goal is to develop my
        creative skills and create innovative design solutions that are both visually appealing and functional.
        I have always had a strong interest in art, and I believe this passion helps me maintain a keen eye for design
        and art trends. The ability to understand these trends allows me to enrich my work as a CMD student and stay
        relevant in the ever-evolving world of design.</p>
